# Simple Shell README

## Description

This projects is our implementation of a simple shell which is the final projects of our first trimester in Holberton SJU.

A simple shell is a text-based interface for interacting with an operating system. Users input commands at a prompt, which are then parsed and executed by the shell. It supports features like command execution, I/O redirection, piping, variables, and scripting. It's a lightweight tool for efficiently managing system resources and executing tasks without a graphical interface. Ours only handles command execution.


## Complilation

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

## Commands

The shell runs the following commads in the ```/bin``` directory

- ls
- pwd
- mkdir
- rm 
- rmdir
- cp
- cat
- echo

- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
